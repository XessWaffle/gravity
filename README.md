# gravity
A numerical simulation of the NBody problem with optimizations using custom kernels created with NVidia's CUDA library.

I've taken an interest in numerical simulations of physical systems, and this is the first of a series of many that I plan to make in the future, including double pendulum,
electrostatics and others as well.
